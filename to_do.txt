- Better window pre-processing (configurable time i.e. 1-second long windows, drop samples with missing data?)
- Implement undersampling technique
- Make window overlap adjustable
- Implement Train - Test - Validation split with similar label distributions (or leave-one-out validation)
- NN Fine-Tuning
- Save model
- Is RF Classifier overtraining?
- Feature extraction for RF and GNB?
